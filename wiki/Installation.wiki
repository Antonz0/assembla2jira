= Introduction =

*assembla2jira* is written in [http://www.lua.org/ LUA] scripting language. To run it you need to prepare/install LUA language interpreter according to your operation system practices and also some required LUA libraries.

= Requirements =
  # *LUA interpreter*. *assembla2jira* is written and tested for Lua 5.1.x version. It should work under Lua 5.2.x but is not tested yet in this environment.
    * Unix users should look in your OS package manager for a port/package of LUA.
    * For Windows users I recommend [http://code.google.com/p/luaforwindows/ Lua for Windows (LfW)] package. Don't forget to add path to your LUA interpreter into PATH environment variable.
  # *JSON.lua* by [http://regex.info/blog/lua/json Jeffrey Friedl] - a pure LUA [http://json.org/ JSON] parser. We're including *MODIFIED* version of this library with our distribution, so do not use original version - it will not work. Link is included only for informational/copyright uses.
